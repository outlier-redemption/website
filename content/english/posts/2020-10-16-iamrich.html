<p>Hi, there. This entry is about a special group of applications that can be found in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store?hl=es&amp;gl=US">Google Play store</a>. I found about these apps procrastinating with data during <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/recherche/doctorat">my PhD</a>. The dataset is stored in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps#googleplaystore.csv">Kaggle</a> and the last update was in 2019.</p>
<p>We can identify these apps by their prices. Let’s make a plot of the app prices of the store. To do this, we choose to use an histogram. Histograms are a practical way of visualizing the way in which a set of values are distributed. We have to group the prices in bins and then count how many apps have a price that lies into each bin. The following graph shows the data:</p>

The plot shows that most of the applications have a small price, close to zero. However, the horizontal axis is extended until values around 400. Indeed, looking closer we see that there is a tiny bar representing some apps with a price close to 400. Let’s make a zoom to see better:</p>

There are around 15 applications with a price similar to 400, why? If we dig a bit further, we get that the names of those apps are:</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;most expensive app (H)&quot;               
##  [2] &quot;&lt;U+0001F48E&gt; I&#39;m rich&quot;                
##  [3] &quot;I&#39;m Rich - Trump Edition&quot;             
##  [4] &quot;I am rich&quot;                            
##  [5] &quot;I am Rich Plus&quot;                       
##  [6] &quot;I Am Rich Premium&quot;                    
##  [7] &quot;I am extremely Rich&quot;                  
##  [8] &quot;I am Rich!&quot;                           
##  [9] &quot;I am rich(premium)&quot;                   
## [10] &quot;I Am Rich Pro&quot;                        
## [11] &quot;I am rich (Most expensive app)&quot;       
## [12] &quot;I Am Rich&quot;                            
## [13] &quot;I am Rich&quot;                            
## [14] &quot;I AM RICH PRO PLUS&quot;                   
## [15] &quot;Eu Sou Rico&quot;                          
## [16] &quot;I&#39;m Rich/Eu sou Rico/&lt;U+0623&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+0627&gt; &lt;U+063A&gt;&lt;U+0646&gt;&lt;U+064A&gt;/&lt;U+6211&gt;&lt;U+5F88&gt;&lt;U+6709&gt;&lt;U+9322&gt;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>All names are equivalent to “I am rich”. The developers of one of these apps describe its utility:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This app do absolutely nothing, but it works like a status symbol.
The icon is really sexy and the app itself shows a beautiful luxury diamond.
This app maybe is the most expensive app on the market and it’s based on other similar “I’m rich” type of apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dataset is a bit out-of-date. There was some cleaning-up, but, if you search for them, some of these apps still exist.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more facts about trashy humanity.</p>
