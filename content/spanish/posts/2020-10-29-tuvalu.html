<p>Have you ever heard about the country <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>? Have you ever heard about <a href="twitch.tv">Twitch</a>? In this post we tell you what they have in common.</p>
<p>You probably heard about the increasingly popular streaming platform Twitch. It has been recently acquired by <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a>. You may have noticed that domain of the platform is “.tv”. Of course, it’s a streaming website, right? Have you ever wonder what does it take to put a “.tv” domain on your website? Well, you have to pay for that. And when you pay for that domain you are implicitly paying to Tuvalu. Indeed, Tuvalu is a lucky micro-state whose country internet domain is “.tv”. The country government has been selling the rights to use it since a long time.</p>

<p>In 2019, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/12/23/tuvalu-is-tiny-island-nation-people-its-cashing-thanks-twitch/">published</a> that Verisign pays around 5 million dollars per year to Tuvalu for the right to administrate the valuable domain (another link in the story: The Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, <a href="https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/">the richest man on Earth</a>, who is the Amazon owner and then Twitch owner). Let’s see which fraction of Tuvalu’s annual gross national income (GNI) represents this “.tv” income.</p>
<p>Tuvalu is not happy with the contract that signed in 2011 with Verisign, which is valid until 2021. Then, the next year could be a great year for Tuvalu if they manage to establish a good new contract given the Twitch explosion.</p>
